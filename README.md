# SimplePerceptron
- Inspired by https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/
- Simple Perceptron Build using PyGame and a basic perceptron.
- To run run **python simplegame.py** or **python simplegraph.py**
- Checkout Merge Request #2 to see how I went from averaging 90% accuracy on the perceptron binary classifier to averaging 99% accuracy. (I thought this was cool!)
